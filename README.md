Homework 3
Project Description
This project will help expand your knowledge on MIPS operations, work with loops
and float numbers.
The project can be developed in groups of 2 people.

Each team will write an assembly program called floatList.asm that will:
1. Prompt the user to enter a list of float or int elements.
2. Store the elements in a buffer
3. Execute the following functions on the list.
4. Each function will be executed as requested by the user, using a prompt system to display the different options available and process what the user wants
5. After the execution of each function, a message prompt must be given to the user to alert the user about the competition of the function.
