Homework 3
Project Description
This project will help expand your knowledge on MIPS operations, work with loops
and float numbers.
The project can be developed in groups of 2 people.

Each team will write an assembly program called floatList.asm that will:
1. Prompt the user to enter a list of float or int elements.
2. Store the elements in a buffer
3. Execute the following functions on the list.
4. Each function will be executed as requested by the user, using a prompt system to display the different options available and process what the user wants
5. After the execution of each function, a message prompt must be given to the user to alert the user about the competition of the function.

FOR PART 1:
1. The list must begin with the ‘ [ ’ character and end with the ‘ ] ’ character.
2. Each number will be separated by a ‘ , ’.
3. Floating point will be represented with the ‘ . ’ character’.
4. All floating-point numbers will have up to two decimal numbers of precision.
5. Integer elements are permitted (processed as float anyways)

FOR PART 3:
1. Sort the list from lowest to highest, consider using the bubble sort
algorithm explained in class.
2. Find the lowest element of the list.
3. Find the greatest element of the list.
4. Find the average value of the elements of the list.
5. Find the sum of all elements of the list.
6. Print a specific index of the list.
7. Print the list contents.
8. Exit.
